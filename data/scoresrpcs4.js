Route 23 between Interstate 80 and US Route 6 is a critical section of highway for rural freight purposes.  It is about 1.5 miles in length. \n \nThis segment connects farmers to the north to grain facilities to the south.  It connects interstate highway traffic to multiple businesses on US Rt 6 and to the south that ship large amounts of freight.  Farmers use this segment to deliver grain to the ADM and Cargill facilities on the Illinois River.  US Silica, Fairmount Minerals, Illinois Sand and others use this segment for shipping silica sand.  Pilkington NSG ships large amounts of plate glass down this segment.  Trucks on this segment travel to ADM Terminal Services to continue shipping industrial goods by barge or rail.  This is also a critical segment of highway that connects truck traffic to rail and barge facilities as well as general industry in Ottawa and the surrounding area.\n \nThis segment of IL Rt. 23 has a critical flaw.  There are extensive train blockages that often block the entire highway for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.  This happens multiple times a day.  This is due to an existing freight rail switchyard next to the highway.  Traffic comes to a halt and backs up throughout the City.  Emergency vehicles cannot get through. Truck freight deliveries are halted.  As rail freight traffic increases due to increased demand for silica sand, and truck traffic increases due to growing industry, the problem continues to worsen.\n \nA solution to the highway blockages needs to be found.  Due to this problem we request that this segment be added as a Critical Rural Freight Corridor.

ROUTE 113 and BNSF RR CROSSING IN COAL CITY ATTAINING CRITICAL RURAL FREIGHT CORRIDOR CRFC STATUS\n\n\n\nThe project is a railroad crossing between the BNSF and State Route 113 improved with a grade separation due to this intersection's important location within the rural freight corridor, which surrounds the Will County Inland Port. An assessment of State Route 113 shall reveal this corridor meets the threshold of the standards set forth for a CRFC due to:\n\n State Route 113 is the return path to the Will County Inland Port for the empty containers\nfilled with the crops from the Mazon Grain Elevator in order to ship Illinois' crops internationally; and\n        State Route 113 provides access to multiple nuclear power generation plants which are\nhigh energy production areas and\nThis crossing on State Route 113 connect to 155 which is a Primary Freight Highway\nSystem PFHS due to its flow of bulk commodities nationally and globally and\n Previously mentioned this State Route provides the means of returning crops for\nInternational shipping and\n State Route 113 is a last mile corridor on the outskirts of the Will County Inland\nLogistics Port providing access to international markets; and\n This corridor provides access to significant rail and freight facilities.\n\n\n\n \nState Route 113 is crucial to the delivery of high volume freight due to its geographic location in the last mile of the freight activity bringing the growth of the international trade at the Will County Inland Port. Because of this location, freight train activity continues to increase in volume and severity i.e. trains have increased in length and have slowed with the addition of a third rail immediately north of the State Route 113 Railroad Crossing. Currently necessary is a grade separation at the crossing which will require widening of the corridor's right of way and shall build additional capacity eliminating the bottlenecks, which occur due to the freight rail blocking this corridor in excess of 5 hours every day.\n\n \n\n \n \n\nThis project has been considered within a corridor of rural improvements with multiple communities affected with the BNSF freight movements from Will southwest to Marshall Counties. At the time consideration for FAST Lane was considered, this project was estimated at $50 million.\n.","fields\/name":"Duane Calbow","fields\/org":"NCICG","submission_length":0.32082588353131902,"connectivity_score":1.084,"economic_impact_score":2.007,"freight_density_score":0.0,"congestion":0.1445,"condition_score":0.2328,"safety_score":0.0,"environment_score":0.35,"master_score":3.8183,"score_rank":131.0,"cum_miles":1572.37323193613},"geometry":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[-88.278471,41.2879],[-88.278402,41.287902],[-88.277414,41.287936],[-88.277349,41.287936],[-88.277312,41.287935],[-88.276904,41.287947],[-88.27659,41.287956],[-88.276407,41.287962],[-88.275893,41.287967],[-88.275759,41.287967],[-88.275312,41.28797],[-88.274873,41.287974],[-88.274497,41.288],[-88.274091,41.288003],[-88.274028,41.288007],[-88.273855,41.288006],[-88.273449,41.288013],[-88.273054,41.28802],[-88.272336,41.288032],[-88.272313,41.288033],[-88.272313,41.288033]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"pk":422.0,"fields\/description":"County Highway 11 includes Evapco Midwest just east of the intersection of State Highway 130.

An assessment of State Route 113 shall reveal this corridor meets the threshold of the standards set forth for a CRFC due to State Route 113 is the return path to the Will County Inland Port for the empty containers filled with the crops from the Mazon Grain Elevator in order to ship Illinois crops internationally and State Route 113 provides access to multiple nuclear power generation plants which are\nhigh energy production areas and This crossing on State Route 113 connect to 155 which is a Primary Freight Highway System PFHS due to its flow of bulk commodities nationally and globally and Previously mentioned this State Route provides the means of returning crops for International shipping and State Route 113 is a last mile corridor on the outskirts of the Will County Inland Logistics Port providing access to international market and This corridor provides access to significant rail and freight facilities.\n\nState Route 113 is crucial to the delivery of high volume freight due to its geographic location in the last mile of the freight activity bringing the growth of the international trade at the Will County Inland Port. Because of this location freight train activity continues to increase in volume and severity i.e. trains have increased in length and have slowed with the addition of a third rail immediately north of the State Route 113 Railroad Crossing. Currently necessary is a grade separation at the crossing which will require widening of the corridor's right of way and shall build additional capacity eliminating the bottlenecks, which occur due to the freight rail blocking this corridor in excess of 5 hours every day.\n\n\nThis project has been considered within a corridor of rural improvements with multiple communities affected with the BNSF

County\nCounty Highway 6 – FAS 372 – Western Road\nWestern Road is 14 miles long and connects Illinois Route 40 on the west to Routes 29 and 18 at the\nCity of Henry. It may be considered the west extension of Rt. 18, which ends at Rt. 29 in Henry.\nTrucks use Western Road to access the Illinois River grain terminals and the fertilizer terminal at Henry.\nRoute 29 connects to Interstate 180 north of Western Road. The area is served by the Iowa Interstate\nRailroad. A multi-use port on the Illinois River is currently being constructed and being developed on\nthe Ozinga property. The Ozinga property is currently a mining operation which has a river terminal\nthat ships sand.\nThe Average Daily Traffic for Western Road is currently 700 vehicles per day.
